Unsolved problems:
- [Problem D](solved/1988D.cpp): The maximum number of round is limited to log2n.
- [Problem E](solved/1988E1.cpp): Use Cartesian tree to calculate the answer. What happens if one of the tree node gets removed?
- [Problem E](solved/1988E2.cpp): Count the contribution of each number to the final answer. A trick to find the second maximum next value.
- [Problem F](solved/1988F.cpp):

Unsolved problems:
- [Problem F](solved/1983F.cpp): Binary search on the answer and check for each new right end if it can lead to a smaller xor value.
- [Problem G](solved/1983G.cpp): Calculate each bit independently. Use the patterns (e.g. 00110011) to precompute the sum to the tree root.
